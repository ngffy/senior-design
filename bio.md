## Project Sought
I am planning on working in UC's MIND lab under Dr. Rashmi Jha on a machine learning project where I will be analyzing data from wearable sensors to evaluate the lifting technique of workers lifting heavy objects. This fulfills several of my broad interests, including machine learning, research, and data analysis.
