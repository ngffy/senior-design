# Milestones
* Testing on Phase 1/Phase 2 data
	* Lab already has good models for this data, so testing will be focused
	  on maintaining or improving results after implementation of filter.
* Testing on Phase 3 data
	* Phase 3 data is noisier than phase 1/phase 2 data, so success here is
	  a major boon
