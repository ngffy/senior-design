## Project Abstract
This project is affiliated with UC's MIND Lab, in coordination with the CDC and
NIOSH. The project is focused on analyzing data obtained from sensors placed on
subjects lifting objects to assess lifting techniques. Some primary focuses are
being able to identify a lifting event and classifying lifts based on risk
level for future back pain.
